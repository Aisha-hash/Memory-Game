# Memory-Game

A website on which a memory game can be played.
A number of cards with the same image (as the back) are displayed. For each of the cards, an additional image is stored that represents the front. Each front image appears twice on the page.
When one of the cards is clicked, it is turned over.
When two cards have been turned over, they are turned back again.
If a pair is found, it disappears.
